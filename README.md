# SnowGrabber
Remember the Owner of this lol https://github.com/Leaked0/BlitzedGrabber


Basically the owner of BlitzedGrabber think remake a new GUI and put new name and use less res make it better, so I publish the stub here with a few moditications you will have to be able to fix them to use it.
(Only easy to fix issues)

If you want the GUI src too (not touched) just star and at 5 star I will deobfuscate itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
